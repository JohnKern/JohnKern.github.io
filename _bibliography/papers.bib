    abstract = {Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) time-of-flight mass spectrometry is an analytical method that detects macromolecules that can be used for proteomic fingerprinting and taxonomic identification in arthropods. The conventional MALDI approach uses fresh laboratory-reared arthropod specimens to build a reference mass spectra library with high-quality standards required to achieve reliable identification. However, this may not be possible to accomplish in some arthropod groups that are difficult to rear under laboratory conditions, or for which only alcohol preserved samples are available. Here, we generated MALDI mass spectra of highly abundant proteins from the legs of 18 Neotropical species of adult field-collected hard ticks, several of which had not been analyzed by mass spectrometry before. We then used their mass spectra as fingerprints to identify each tick species by applying machine learning and pattern recognition algorithms that combined unsupervised and supervised clustering approaches. Both Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) classification algorithms were able to identify spectra from different tick species, with LDA achieving the best performance when applied to field-collected specimens that did have an existing entry in a reference library of arthropod protein spectra. These findings contribute to the growing literature that ascertains mass spectrometry as a rapid and effective method to complement other well-established techniques for taxonomic identification of disease vectors, which is the first step to predict and manage arthropod-borne pathogens.},

  abstract={Memristors enable the computation of matrix-vector multiplications (MVM) in memory and, therefore, show great potential in highly increasing the energy efficiency of deep neural network (DNN) inference accelerators. However, computations in memristors suffer from hardware non-idealities and are subject to different sources of noise that may negatively impact system performance. In this work, we theoretically analyze the mean squared error of DNNs that use memristor crossbars to compute MVM. We take into account both the quantization noise, due to the necessity of reducing the DNN model size, and the programming noise, stemming from the variability during the programming of the memristance value. Simulations on pre-trained DNN models showcase the accuracy of the analytical prediction. Furthermore the proposed method is almost two order of magnitude faster than Monte-Carlo simulation, thus making it possible to optimize the implementation parameters to achieve minimal error for a given power constraint.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper presents a quantized Kalman filter implemented using unreliable memories. We consider that both the quantization and the unreliable memories introduce errors in the computations, and we develop an error propagation model that takes into account these two sources of errors. In addition to providing updated Kalman filter equations, the proposed error model accurately predicts the covariance of the estimation error and gives a relation between the performance of the filter and its energy consumption, depending on the noise level in the memories. Then, since memories are responsible for a large part of the energy consumption of embedded systems, optimization methods are introduced to minimize the memory energy consumption under the desired estimation performance of the filter. The first method computes the optimal energy levels allocated to each memory bank individually, and the second one optimizes the energy allocation per groups of memory banks. Simulations show a close match between the theoretical analysis and experimental results. Furthermore, they demonstrate an important reduction in energy consumption of more than 50%.},

  abstract={Kalman filters are widely used for real-time estimation of dynamic systems, and they sometimes need to be implemented on energy-constrained devices. A Kalman filter implementation from unreliable memories is considered, where the flipping probability of a bit in a memory cell directly depends on its energy consumption. The degradation in estimation performance caused by the noise in the memory is theoretically investigated. Updated equations are then developed for the Kalman filter, taking into account the new source of noise from the unreliable memory. Finally, a method is proposed to optimize the bit energy allocation in the memory, and it is shown from numerical simulations that this method allows for important energy gains.},

  abstract={Memristors allow computing in memory, which may be leveraged by deep neural network (DNN) accelerators to reduce energy footprint. However, such gains in energy efficiency come at the cost of noise on the computation results due to the analog nature of memristors. In this work, we introduce a theoretical framework to estimate the mean squared error (MSE) of a memristor-based DNN. We propose an efficient software implementation of this framework which is shown to be orders of magnitude faster than using Monte-Carlo simulations. Additionally, we study two different techniques for mapping convolutional layers to memristors and compare their relative impact on the mean squared error and its computation time. The accuracy of the proposed analysis is first evaluated on a simple regression problem, and then on a more complex classification task with a network capable of achieving high accuracy on the CIFAR-10 dataset, which shows that our method is efficient over practical up-to-date DNNs. The proposed framework is then used to perform a meta-heuristic optimization of the memristor maximal conductance value so as to minimize the energy usage.11The code for the framework presented in this work is available at https://github.com/sebastienwood/MemSE},
